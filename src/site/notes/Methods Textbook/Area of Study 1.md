From the study design:

> In this area of study students cover transformations of the plane and the behaviour of some elementary functions of a single real variable, including key features of their graphs such as axis intercepts, stationary points, points of inflection, domain (including maximal, implied or natural domain), co-domain and range, asymptotic behaviour and symmetry. The behaviour of functions and their graphs is to be explored in a variety of modelling contexts and theoretical investigations.

I will take you through this topic in the order of set theory, relations, functions, and graphs.

Don't worry, this will be fun.

# Set Theory

Now this isn't in the study design, but you're expected to know it anyways.

Set theory is basically any type of math to do with sets that are literally just groups of items related in some way, shape, or form.

In methods we only deal with sets of numbers.

This is a diagram of all numbers:

Now don't worry if you don't understand what all these letters mean, we'll go through them in a second.

$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all natural numbers. What is that? Literally just all positive integers (whole number). The numbers that you thought were the only existent ones when you were younger.

$\mathbb{Z}$ is an **extension** of $\mathbb{N}$ to also include $0$ and negative integers as well

$\mathbb{Q}$ is an extension to $\mathbb{Z}$ to also include any number which can be expressed a fraction, aka rational numbers.

$\mathbb{R}$ is the set that encompasses $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{I}$ which is the set of irrational numbers, basically numbers like $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, etc.

Complex and imaginary numbers aren't talked about in methods so we son't go over them.
