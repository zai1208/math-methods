I do not believe that textbooks should be over 1000 pages long with questions that do not help with the content, which is why I have written this. This "textbook" is divided into 2 sections, the first is all the content subdivided into the 4 area of studies. The second section is tips on answering questions along with specifically chosen exam questions and how to tackle unknown questions.

The 4 Area of studies are:
- [[Methods Textbook/Area of Study 1\|Area of Study 1]] - Functions, relations, and graphs
- [[Methods Textbook/Area of Study 2\|Area of Study 2]] - Algebra, number, and structure 
- [[Methods Textbook/Area of Study 3\|Area of Study 3]] - Calculus
- [[Methods Textbook/Area of Study 4\|Area of Study 4]] - Data analysis, probability, and statistics
